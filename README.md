# simple-discord-ai
A self-hostable chatbot for Discord that utilizes ollama.

## Installation
1. [Install Ollama](https://ollama.com/download/)
2. `pip install discord.py ollama requests`
3. Open `runStable.py` and replace `TOKEN = ''` with `TOKEN = 'YOUR_BOT_TOKEN'`
4. Run `runStable.py`
- Note: if you want the bot to work without it being pinged/mentioned, use runNoMention.py
- Note 2: Use run.py or runNoMention.py to use the HIGHLY EXPERIMENTAL memory system. (I would advise against this as it is highly broken, and is far from good)

## Usage
To use the bot, ping it via its username (e.g. @bot) or reply to it.

## Support
